Why I Should Be Considered for the Synopsys R&D Internship

I am a passionate VLSI aspirant and have spent a significant amount of time working on RTL-based projects, 
strengthening my skills in Verilog, SystemVerilog, and digital design. My understanding spans key protocols 
and architectures like AHB, APB, SPI, and RISC-V pipelining, which I’ve implemented and explored through 
various hands-on projects. What draws me to Synopsys R&D is not just the technology, but the nature of the 
work itself — taking new or existing designs and rigorously pushing for more efficient solutions. I once had 
the opportunity to interact with a Synopsys R&D engineer who explained her work, and that moment made me 
realise this is exactly what I’ve been looking for.

I may not be the most skilled among thousands of applicants, but I bring with me unmatched passion,
a deep curiosity, and the determination to work hard. My goal is not just to build a career, but to 
contribute something meaningful to the semiconductor industry — even if it's a small step.

Thank You
